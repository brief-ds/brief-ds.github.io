## Introduction to the Apollo Guidance Computer
Apollo Guidance Computer was a digital computer produced for the Apollo program. The [command module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_command_and_service_module) flies to the moon orbit. The [lunar module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Lunar_Module) then descends to the moon and makes way back to the command module.

The [Virtual AGC](https://ibiblio.org/apollo/) was a project started in 2003 by volunteers and took about 20 years to restore the software line by line into digital form. I can hardly find an adjective to describe the amount of effort invovled.

The [Colossus](https://ibiblio.org/apollo/Colossus.html) software runs on the command module and the [Luminary](https://ibiblio.org/apollo/Luminary.html) software runs on the lunar module. There is another significant [Abort Guidance System](https://ibiblio.org/apollo/yaAGS.html) as a backup computer system, made by a different company, different team of people, only using common hardware technology then.

The Apollo Guidance Computer does not have a microprocessor in the modern sense. The processing logic is integrated in the circuit, so it runs at the same speed as the memory access. It is programmed by an assembly language. Furthermore, an interpreter interprets a high-level interpreter language.

## Fixed-width arithmetic
The Apollo Guidance Computer only does integer multiplication and division. So how were [trigonometric functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometry) computed, essential to space flight?

```
                     A_major  A_minor
                     B_major  B_minor
 -------------------------------------
                     A_minor x B_minor
           A_major x B_minor   zeros
           B_major x A_minor   zeros
 A_major x B_major    zeros    zeros
```
