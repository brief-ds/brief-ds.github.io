## Introduction to the Apollo Guidance Computer
Apollo Guidance Computer was a digital computer produced for the Apollo program. The [command module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_command_and_service_module) flies to the moon orbit. The [lunar module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Lunar_Module) then descends to the moon and makes way back to the command module.

The [Virtual AGC](https://ibiblio.org/apollo/) was a project started in 2003 by volunteers and took about 20 years to restore the software line by line into digital form. I can hardly find an adjective to describe the amount of effort invovled.

The [Colossus](https://ibiblio.org/apollo/Colossus.html) software runs on the command module and the [Luminary](https://ibiblio.org/apollo/Luminary.html) software runs on the lunar module. There is another significant [Abort Guidance System](https://ibiblio.org/apollo/yaAGS.html) as a backup computer system, made by a different company, different team of people, only using common hardware technology then.

The Apollo Guidance Computer does not have a microprocessor in the modern sense. The processing logic is integrated in the circuit, so it runs at the same speed as memory. It runs an assembly language and an interpreter that interprets an interpreter language.
