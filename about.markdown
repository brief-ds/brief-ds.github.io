We develop lean software and hardware for intelligent computing. Our mission statement:

## How to forecast
We consider that any two objects _may_ boast of predictive power for each other. The problem is to compute the conditional distribution of <math><mi>B</mi></math> in the future given information about <math><mi>A</mi></math> up to now. We build [Time Series Terminal](https://tsterm.com).

## MaxSave
We are raising for [maxsave.net](https://maxsave.net), a long-term saving platform for young people in the UK. The front page will look like an instagram of content for the Gen Z's interest, with computational technology packed behind.

## How to compute: a unified look
The neurons excite and inhibit. Where it does not inhibit, it attends. The three architectures are fundamentally very similar:

* [Turing machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine)
* attention-based mechanism
* [Long-short term memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory)

## Lean hardware and software
We favour simple hardware and software, something high schoolers can play with.

* [micrograd](https://github.com/brief-ds/micrograd): kid-friendly autodiff library, competitive in performance
* [RISC-V](https://riscv.org): an open instruction set for microprocessor
* [Plan 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs): once intended successor to Unix
