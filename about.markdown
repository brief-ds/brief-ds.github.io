The firm is an Intellectual Property holding company. We develop novel and lean technology for general time series forecasting, and pervasive mobile, cloud computing. We care about the following problems.

## How to forecast
We consider that any two objects _may_ boast of predictive power for each other. The problem is to compute the conditional distribution of <math><mi>B</mi></math>'s change in the future given <math><mi>A</mi></math>'s change at present. We build [TS Terminal](https://tsterm.com).

## How to compute: a unified look
We see two phases: process current information into memory, then based on the memory, generates by self what to attend to in the next step, and receive new information (from memory or outside) in the next step. The three architectures are fundamentally very similar:

* [Turing Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine)
* attention-based mechanism
* [Long-Short Term Memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory)

## Lean Hardware and Software
We favour simple hardware and software. Something a high schooler can play with.

* [RISC-V](https://riscv.org): an open ISA (Instruction set architecture) for CPU, the chip that performs computing.
* [Plan 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs): once intended successor to Unix. The whole operating system compiles within minutes, with many cloud-like features out of box.
